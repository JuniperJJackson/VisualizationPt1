# User Behavior

This project shows how User data can be saved to a file and how we are able to use that same data to recreate the path the user took while playing the game.

## Android Version

-The user is given rotating yellow cubes that they are to pickup within a given timelimit by touching them

-If the user picks up all of the objects within the timelimit they "win"

-User touch locations are written to a file on whatever device they are using called "Debug.txt:

-The script uses a reference to a datapoint called "location" which is instantiated every time the player moves 1 unit farther from the previous position.

-Then the position of the location gameObject is stored along with the timestamp in the debug.txt file.
